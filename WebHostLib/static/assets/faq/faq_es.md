# Preguntas frecuentes (Modificadas para el server de Naix! EN CONSTRUCCION) 

## What is a randomizer?

A randomizer is a modification of a game which reorganizes the items required to progress through that game. A
normal play-through might require you to use item A to unlock item B, then C, and so forth. In a randomized
game, you might first find item C, then A, then B.

This transforms the game from a linear experience into a puzzle, presenting players with a new challenge each time they
play. Putting items in non-standard locations can require the player to think about the game world and the items they
encounter in new and interesting ways.

## What is a multiworld?

While a randomizer shuffles a game, a multiworld randomizer shuffles that game for multiple players. For example, in a
two player multiworld, players A and B each get their own randomized version of a game, called a world. In each
player's game, they may find items which belong to the other player. If player A finds an item which belongs to
player B, the item will be sent to player B's world over the internet. This creates a cooperative experience, requiring
players to rely upon each other to complete their game.

## What does multi-game mean?

While a multiworld game traditionally requires all players to be playing the same game, a multi-game multiworld allows
players to randomize any of the supported games, and send items between them. This allows players of different
games to interact with one another in a single multiplayer environment. All this is handled by the server.

## That is cool! What games can I play?

Here is a list of games supported by Naix's server [Supported Games](/games). This includes all games supported in the
official archipelago server, plus a couple that are on beta state, but are "stable enough" to be used on a multiworld game.

## Can I generate a single-player game with Archipelago?

Yes. All of the supported games can be generated as single-player experiences. However, please don't use this mirror
for this, and instead use the official [Archipelago](https://archipelago.gg) site.

## How do I get started?

If you come from Naix's server, there you should get some instructions to slowly ease you into this system. Follow
the instructions there and you should be good!

Again, if you don't came from there, refer to the official [Archipelago](https://archipelago.gg) site to start.

## Does everyone need to be connected at the same time?

There are two different play-styles that are common for Archipelago multiworld sessions. These sessions can either
be considered synchronous (or "sync"), where everyone connects and plays at the same time, or asynchronous (or "async"),
where players connect and play at their own pace. The setup for both is identical. The difference in play-style is how
you and your friends choose to organize and play your multiworld. Most groups decide on the format before creating
their multiworld.

Normally in Naix's server we play async games, so no pressure to be connected at the same time.


## I can't keep playing, do I ruin everyone's game?

No! If you can't keep playing give the organizer a shout and he can release all the items from your game so people
recieved them. No harm done.


## I want to participate but cant play in the following X days. Can I still play?

Yes! But please let us know when that is the case. Given that we have been getting stuck behind people not answering in the pass, in Naix's server
we reserve the right to liberate games if people stop answering at all after a couple of days.

## What are some common terms I should know?

As randomizers and multiworld randomizers have been around for a while now, there are quite a few common terms used
by the communities surrounding them. A list of Archipelago jargon and terms commonly used by the community can be
found in the [Glossary](/glossary/en).

## What happens if an item is placed somewhere it is impossible to get?

The randomizer has many strict sets of rules it must follow when generating a game. One of the functions of these rules
is to ensure items necessary to complete the game will be accessible to the player. Many games also have a subset of
rules allowing certain items to be placed in normally unreachable locations, provided the player has indicated they are
comfortable exploiting certain glitches in the game.


## Where do I get the connection information? (THIS NEEDS UPDATE)

When the game is started I will post an achipelago room link and pin it. 
Once you open it, it will open something that looks like the green image I have attached. 
There you can see your username and also the room port (the number after archipelago.gg, so in that example, 57719)

To connect the data you need is your username (also called in games "slot name") and the port. Depending on the game is how you need to input that information. The port may not appear, and in that case where it says host you need to put archipelago.gg;XXXXX with XXXXX the port. Ask for help about this if you need to! I know it is confusing as I cannot put something that works for every game.

An IMPORTANT part is that the port number WILL change after some inactivity time. Open the room link again and input the port in your login information. You will be able to resume your game as normal. If the port number does not appear refresh the website and it should be loaded 


## What happens if I get stuck while playing? 

A situation that might happen is that you get stuck in your game. It is not uncommon to miss an item because it might be 
in another world. Thankfully the system has ways to help!

There is a system of hints. Every couple items you collect you get hint points. 
Get enough hint points and you can ask the system where is that glorious item you are missing to progress.

How to use this system? Well you need to connect to a text client. How you connect depends a little bit on if your game has a text client or not. This could be a console inside the game (like Minecraft and Risk of Rain 2) or an external app. In the later case the text client looks something like the attached image. In some cases your game will require a text client to even play (and in that case you can use that same window to ask for hints) or you will need to download a text client from archipelago.gg. Connect there (using the information as in the last question) and you will be able to ask for hints.

For hints, input !hint NAME_OF_ITEM and the game will give you the location of the item in the whole game, or suggest an item with a similar name. If you dont know where to obtain that precious item or the exact name, ask arround and we will sort it out!

Another thing you can do if you are stuck and want to help ... it so play Sudoku! There is an app that connect to the server (same way as before) and allows you to play Sudoku. If you complete it, you will give us a free random hint for the game, wooo!


## I don't understand something/something is not clear, what do I do?

Ask! Or roll with it for now! The first couple of times it is confusing to get the head arround how it all works. 
I promise it clicks after a game (reason why I have got people to keep playing multiple times ðŸ˜› ).

If you think something is missing in this site please let me know so I can add it.
